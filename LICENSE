As far as i am concerned the SQLite database has no licensed
specified, therefore i assume it's public domain. If you think
otherwise please complain to abuse@fwt.no or B&W for not putting up a
license.

The data was retreived from the open internet, located at http://bwgroupsupport.com/download/rs232
